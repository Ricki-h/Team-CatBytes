    <h1>AINE'S FAVORITE MUSICS</h1>
    <h2>Maybe it can help you to discover new interests ;3</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Hello, my name's Aine and today I'll show you my Top 5 musics! Hope you like it and have a wonderful day ^w^</p>
    <br>
    <h2>1 - Mind Over Matter by Young the Giant</h2>
    <img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273c4cea35a5ac2a8a7d451781b" title="Mind Over Matter - Cover (Spotify)">
    <p>Well, this music is, at the moment, my favorite! Why you ask me? Just because it reminds me so much of Dokja and Jonghyeook from <a href="https://omniscient-readers-viewpoint.fandom.com/wiki/Omniscient_Reader%27s_Viewpoint" target="orv">ORV</a> (Omnscient Reader's Viewpoint), a novel that is amazing, I recommend reading it! </p>
    <br>
    <h2>2 - Fine by Lemon Demon</h2>
    <img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2735d2f39265b6ffeebcae4bfaf" title="Fine - Cover (Spotify)">
    <p>For this second music I was a little confused, but it turned out that I ended up putting this one anyways. Fine is a really good music, when I listen to it I'm remembered of Dazai Osamu from Bungo Stray Dogs. If you're having a nice day with a (weird?) vibe this is the correct music for you!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>3 - My Ordinary Life by The Living Tombstone</h2>
    <img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273227edcd51b6622cdcbe9f43c" title="My Ordinary Life - Cover (Spotify)">
    <p>Okay, this band is incredible and so is their musics, but My Ordinary Life is the one that much gets my attention, I don't know why but I feel really good listening to this music, principally this part "I feel fear for the very last timeeeee", yeah this feels pretty good -w-</p>
    <br>
    <h2>4 - Blue Hair by TV Girl</h2>
    <img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2731556d166d0ed059b34a00e1b" title="Blue Hair - Cover (Spotify)">
    <p>What should I say about this music? Yeah, it's sad what she talks about, a lot of people suffer this even nowadays, but I love musics that show the real world like this because we can't be lenient about these kinds of things and in the end she ends up happy you know, right? It says something like this "Last time heard she was leaving...with the boy who likes her hair" so yup one of my favorites.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>5 - Mad Hatter by Melanie Martinez</h2>
    <img src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/1e11c7d5-42e2-40e6-8231-42d84e5f5041/d9xwes6-5e8dd017-2635-404e-b4d4-c5df3b920b08.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzFlMTFjN2Q1LTQyZTItNDBlNi04MjMxLTQyZDg0ZTVmNTA0MVwvZDl4d2VzNi01ZThkZDAxNy0yNjM1LTQwNGUtYjRkNC1jNWRmM2I5MjBiMDguanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.VDpYoLTQJJchFW76a7lWPfRpIXTsx7O1m9iVVQcLxiU" title="Mad Hatter - Image (IzzyDesign on DevianArt)">
    <p>YES! Finally the time for my FAVORTIE SINGER EVER. I love Melanie's musics, they always talk about problems from the real world and criticize them in a creative way, we can't just turn our backs to the truth, it happens and we can't hide it. Mad Hatter is one of various exemples for this when it says "the normals they make me afraid~ the crazies they make me feel safe~", ("why would she write that?") Because it's true, humans are cruel and sometimes people with no choice find kindness where you less could've thinked you would find it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>That's it for today, maybe next time I can make something about animes or series, what do you think? Bye bye!!</p>
